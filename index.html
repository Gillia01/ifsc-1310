    <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      After showing my first attempt to a family member, they thought it looked good. Some things that they recommded a better color scheme. I agree with this change because I feel like grey and white colors look boring and not as apealing. Some areas where I feel like I need to improve on are trying to get an image loaded on the screen, and to make sure the links works. Doing this for the first time helped me get a better understanding some of my strengths and weaknesses. When I first started this class I thought it was going to be another coding class where I have to try and learn a lot of these different terms. It turns out like you said a lot of these are terms are pretty straight foward which is nice.

    <h2> Progressive Enhancement Writing Assignment</h2>
    <p> Progessive enhancement is used in web development as a strategy that can help build a foundation that works for all users. I doesn't matter which device they use, but it improves when a user uses a more upgraded device. Baseline Experience is what starts progressive enhancement. You start by creating a basic version of a website or web application that has core technologies and features that are supported by most browswers. Next is Enhance Features developers can add features by using HTML or JavaScript. These may be interactive elements. Accessibility helps users understand the website easier. Resilience is another core part because the website can still work on older devices.  </p>
