    <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      After showing my first attempt to a family member, they thought it looked good. Some things that they recommded a better color scheme. I agree with this change because I feel like grey and white colors look boring and not as apealing. Some areas where I feel like I need to improve on are trying to get an image loaded on the screen, and to make sure the links works. Doing this for the first time helped me get a better understanding some of my strengths and weaknesses. When I first started this class I thought it was going to be another coding class where I have to try and learn a lot of these different terms. It turns out like you said a lot of these are terms are pretty straight foward which is nice.
